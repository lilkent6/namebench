These docs cover use of the UI, for command-line specific help, see UsingNameBenchCommandLine

=Using namebench=

When you start namebench on Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux with the required libraries (python-tk), you will be greeted with a basic interface:

The defaults should do the right thing for nearly everyone, so most people can safely click "Start Benchmark". Once the benchmark runs, a web browser should pop-up with a detailed analysis. 

==Options==

===nameservers===

This is a list of any specific nameservers that you would like to make sure are included in the benchmark. By default, this includes all of the nameservers that your system is currently using. You can specify multiple nameservers by using a comma or space in between them.

===Include global DNS providers===

Selecting this will include well-known DNS providers with global coverage into your benchmark. At the time of this writing, this includes OpenDNS and UltraDNS. Power-users can alter this list by editing namebench.cfg.

===Include best available regional DNS services===

Selecting this will include the fastest regional DNS servers in your test. This works by quickly testing the health of over 1,000 DNS servers around the world, and selecting only the fastest servers that provide correct responses. 

NOTE: The namebench UI restricts you to testing a total of 10 nameservers at a time. If your system has a primary and secondary DNS server, and 4 global DNS servers to test, only the best 4 regional DNS servers will be used in the benchmark.

===Benchmark Data Source===

namebench works by requesting website addresses from each DNS server. This dialog allows you to select where this list of host names are generated from. The most accurate data source is your browser history, though for smaller histories, the benchmark may bias toward your currently configured primary DNS server. This list contains each browser that namebench was able to find a history for, along with how many records it found in the history file (in parenthesis). 

This list also contains "Alexa Top Global Domains (10000)". This data source contains a list of the domains for the  top 10,000 most popular websites on the Internet. While this data set is useful, it does not necessarily reflect your DNS use. For example, this list contains many domains in China that someone who lives in Finland is unlikely to query for.

===Benchmark Data Selection Mode===

This option affects how records from your browser history or Alexa data are selected. For most users, weighted is the best option.

  * Weighted: For a dataset that has no duplicates, bias the selection toward the front of the list. If the dataset has duplicates, this algorithm automatically falls back to random mode. This mode was written primarily to support the Alexa dataset, which lists domains in order of popularity.  If the data source is large enough, it will limit repeats to 3 per domain name.

  * Random: A mostly random selection of hosts from the data source. If the data source is large enough, it will limit repeats to 3 per host name.

  * Chunk: Selects a random sequential chunk from the data source. This option is good for replaying a browser session. 

===Number of tests===

This option selects how many requests should be tested for each DNS server. The more tests, the more the results should reflect real-world usage. By default we send 125 requests for each name server.

===Number of Runs===

How many times the test is run. By default, we only run the test once.. Since each run repeats the same list of requests, each subsequent run should serve cached data. Running the test more than once can be useful to measure the performance difference between non-cached requests and cached requests

== Output ==

Once the run completes successfully, your default web browser should pop-up with a report. It should be self-explanatory:
