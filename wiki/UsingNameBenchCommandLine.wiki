#summary Using the command-line version of namebench

= namebench command-line usage =

First, download the namebench source code file and extract it. You will also need <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> 2.5 - 2.7 installed. Mac OS X and most UNIX distributions come with this already. Assuming all of this, it's normally just as easy as typing:

{{{
 ./namebench.py 
}}}

If namebench launches a graphical window (because you have Tk), you can use the -x option to force it to command-line mode.

namebench will test the nameservers your machine is currently using, plus
the popular global DNS services, and the best 4-6 additional name servers
that it can find for you. It will output some text-graphs and URL's for more
a more detailed performance analysis of each nameserver.

If you want to specify an additional set of name services, simply add the IP
to the command-line, or edit namebench.cfg:

  ./namebench.py 10.0.0.1 192.168.0.1
