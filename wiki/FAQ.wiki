== namebench fails to start on Windows 2000, XP, or Vista ==

_This application has failed to start because the application configuration 
is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem._

If you get this error, you need to install the Visual C++ libraries from Microsoft:

== namebench fails to start on Mac OS X ==

Due to to the dependency on <a href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">PyObjC</a>, namebench requires an Intel Mac running Mac OS X 10.5 or higher. If you do not meet this requirement, you can still use namebench with the command-line or with a slightly ugly U I by downloading the "source" version of namebench.

Once extracted, you may run the following from the namebench directory to force a GUI to open:

I_LOVE_TK=1 ./namebench.py

== How do you use the DNS servers recommended? ==

See http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using.html

== I get different results each time I run namebench. Why? ==

The first run is the one that is most likely to be accurate. The more times to run namebench, the more likely you are to be repeating the same queries over and over again. This will skew your results toward the closest nameserver to you, rather than the one most likely to have your requests cached during normal operations.

One work-around to avoid this is to switch between the Alexa dataset and your favorite browser as a history source. As the Alexa dataset is global in scope, it will tend to skew toward nameservers that cache queries from around the world, however.

== Are all of the "regional servers" public? == 

_If I do a test run, and it points me at various regional DNS servers, run
by ISPs or transit providers, are these servers officially "public"?_

No. Many regional nameservers are only available to their direct or indirect customers. The ones that do show up on your list are the ones that do allow recursive lookups to your machine however. Like accessing a web page found on a search engine, it is possible that the DNS server was misconfigured to allow public access, and may disappear at any time.

== I run a public nameserver, how do I get added or removed? ==

At the moment, the best way is to open an issue with a list of IP's and names to go along with them.

== How do I submit a bug? ==
